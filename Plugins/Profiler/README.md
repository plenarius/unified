## Pathing outcomes

`NWNX_PROFILER_ENABLE_PATHING_OUTCOMES` counts how each in-area path request (`CNWSModule::PlotPathInArea`) ends and pushes the counts every `NWNX_PROFILER_PATHING_OUTCOMES_INTERVAL` seconds as `PathingOutcome` with field `Count` and tags:

| Tag | Values |
| --- | ------ |
| Area | Area resref |
| AILevel | The creature's AI level, `-1` (default) to `4`. In an area without players creatures run at `0`, where a move whose straight line is blocked fails at once and is retried |
| Outcome | `Complete`, `Partial` (complete, but the last waypoint stops more than 1m short of the requested range: the engine's straight-line fallback), `Failed` |
| Controller | `PC` (player-controlled) or `NPC` |
| GridSearch | `true` if the short-range grid search was used |
| NoTileRoute | `true` if the tile-to-tile route search found no route during the request |

### Logging single requests

These settings need `NWNX_PROFILER_ENABLE_PATHING_OUTCOMES`. They write lines to the NWNX log, with the creature's tag, template, object id and AI level, and the start and goal:

- `NWNX_PROFILER_PATHING_LOG_SLOW_MS`: log each planner call (one `CNWSModule::PlotPath`, the same call the `PlotPath` timing measures) that takes at least this many milliseconds. Each call runs inside the main loop, so a slow call is a server stall. `0` turns this off. The line splits the time into the inter-area search (`ComputeInterAreaPath`), the in-area planner (`PlotPathInArea`) and everything else, so it shows where a stall goes. It gives the request as the creature made it (`at entry`: start, goal, their areas, and the object it is moving to), because the planner rewrites those fields while it works (`after`). It is logged as the call ends, so requests that never finish are logged too.
- `NWNX_PROFILER_PATHING_LOG_FAILED`: log failed requests (counted when the in-area planner finishes) of creatures at `NWNX_PROFILER_PATHING_LOG_FAILED_MIN_AI_LEVEL` or higher. The default, `2` (normal), leaves out creatures in areas without players. Set it to `-1` to log every failed request. A request that fails in the inter-area search, before the in-area planner runs, is not counted.
- `NWNX_PROFILER_PATHING_LOG_INTERVAL`: log a creature at most once in this many seconds, separately for each kind of line.
